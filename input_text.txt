If applied to a text file, the function is able to:
	a. read a desired number of characters (including just one) from the file, and return them as a string;
	b. read all the file contents, and return them as a string;
	c. if there is nothing more to read (the virtual reading head reaches the end of the file), the function returns an empty string.
