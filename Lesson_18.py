    Sequence and Mutabilit:
    --------------------------
    A sequence type is a type of data in Python which is able to store more than one value (or less than one, 
    as a sequence may be empty), and these values can be sequentially (hence the name) browsed, element by 
    element.
    As the for loop is a tool especially designed to iterate through sequences, we can express the definition as: 
    a sequence is data which can be scanned by the for loop.
    Examples of sequence type: list, tuple, and dictionary
    mutability - is a property of any of Python's data that describes its readiness to be freely changed during 
    program execution. There are two kinds of Python data: 
        a. mutable data - Mutable data can be freely updated at any time. Exampeles: list
        b. immutable data - Immutable data can not be updated. Example : tuple
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Tuple:  
    ------
    a. Tuple is an immutable sequence.    
    b. It behave like a list but can't be modified.i.e. 

    Note: each tuple element may be of a different type (floating-point, integer, or any other not-as-yet-introduced 
    kind of data).

    How to use a tuple: continued
    What else can tuples do for you?

        a. the len() function accepts tuples, and returns the number of elements contained inside;
        b. the + operator can join tuples together (we've shown you this already)
        c. the * operator can multiply tuples, just like lists;
        d.  the in and not in operators work in the same way as in lists.
