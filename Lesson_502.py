    Regular expression:
    -------------------

    b.  Regular expressions are used for data cleaning or pattern matching in text files.

    What is Python Regular expression (RegEx)?

        a.  A python regular expression is a sequence of metacharacters that define a search pattern.
        b.  We use these patterns in a string-searching algorithm to "find" or "find and replace" on strings.
        c. The term "Regular Expression" is frequently shortend to "RegEx".

    Python RegEx: Metacharacters
    ----------------------------
    a.  Every character in a Python RegEx is either a metacharacter or a regular character.
    b.  A metacharater has a special character, wheras a regular character matches itself.

    1.  The '^' : checks if the string starts with a particular character or a particular word.
    2.  The '$' : checks if the string ends with a particular character or a particular word.
    3.  The '|' : checks the either / or condition.
    4.  The '+' : checks one or more occurence of a character in the string.
