            Advanced Perspective of Classes and OOP
            ---------------------------------------
    In this class, you will learn about the following topics:

        a.  Classes, instances, attributes, methods, as well as working with class and instance data;
        b.  Shallow and deep operations;
        c.  Abstract classes, method overriding, static and class methods, special methods;
        d.  Inheritance, polymorphism, subclasses, and encapsulation;
        e.  Advanced exception handling techniques;
        f.  The pickle and shelve modules;
        G.  metaclasses.

            Classes, Instances, Attributes, Methods — introduction
            ------------------------------------------------------
    
    Definitions:
    -----------
        a.  class — an idea, blueprint, or recipe for an instance;
        b.  instance — an instantiation of the class; very often used interchangeably with the term 'object';
        c.  object — Python's representation of data and methods; objects could be aggregates of instances;
        d.  attribute — any object or class trait; could be a variable or method;
        e.  method — a function built into a class that is executed on behalf of the class or object; 
            some say that it's a 'callable attribute';
        f.  type — refers to the class that was used to instantiate the object.
Note:
----
    a.  Everything in python is an object (functions, modules, lists, etc.)
    b.  Even classes are instances. 

Why is everything in Python organized as objects?
    Because an object is a very useful culmination of all the terms described above:

        a.  it is an independent instance of class, and it contains and aggregates some specific and valuable 
            data in attributes relevant to individual objects;
        b.  it owns and shares methods used to perform actions.

The following topics will be dealt in this advanced python tutorial
-------------------------------------------------------------------
a.  creation and use of decorators
b.  implementation of core syntax;
c.  class and static methods;
d.  abstract methods;
e.  comparison of inheritance and composition;
f.  attribute encapsulation;
g.  exception chaining;
h.  object persistence;
i.  metaprogramming.
